Some personal learning notes.

1. Single command "make" to get wanted results.
	* Solution 1: Put the rule of finally wanted generated file on the top of all other rules. Then the "make" command will default to generate this file and use its rule to link other files.
	 For example:
		fileA: ...
			gcc ...
		fileB: ...
			gcc ...
		fileC: ...
			gcc ...
	Asuume only these three files. Here "make" will only try to generate fileA by linked files of fileA. If we put rule of fileC before fileA, then "make" will only try to generate fileC by its linked files. Like this:
		fileC: ...
			gcc ...
		fileA:	...
			gcc ...
		fileB: ...
			gcc ...
	* Solution 2: Set the variable .DEFAULT_GOAL as the wanted filename. This assignment can appear anywhere, no matter how many other file generation rules ahead of it.
	e.g.
		fileA: ...
			gcc ...
		fileB: ...
			gcc ...
		fileC: ...
			gcc ...
		.DEFAULT_GOAL := fileB
	The single command "make" will only try to generate fileB on default.
